# Deploying Sentiment Analysis Model

### Project Overview

In this project, we will construct a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) data set. You will create this model using [Amazon's SageMaker service](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/?nc1=h_ls). In addition, we will deploy the model and construct a simple web app that will interact with the deployed model.

The deployment project which we will be working on is intended to be done using Amazon's SageMaker platform. In particular, it is assumed that we have a working notebook instance in which you can clone the deployment repository.


### The Data

The dataset is called [IMDB dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) comes from [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL)](https://ai.stanford.edu/) which has been a center of excellence for Artificial Intelligence research, teaching, theory, and practice
